    <h2>The Meat Pie. A humble celebration of the culinary skill of the British chef. Deeply rooted in British culture, the pie
        is today one the most popular dishes in the UK and a staple part of the British diet, with 75% of the British public eating pie at least
        once a month. But how did it get here? And how has it become so popular? This is a Brief History of a British Culinary Masterpiece.</h2>

     <h3 id="headline">The Start of Pie</h3>   
    
     <p>Pie historians believe the first pie (or at least something similar to the pie we know and love today) was invented in ancient Egypt.
         Pies then were mainly filled with honey and cased in oats, wheat or barley, however a recipe for a chicken pie was also discovered carved
         into a stone tablet, dated around 2000bc.</p>

    <p>Thousands of years later the Ancient Greeks are believed to have invented pie pastry.  Pies were mentioned in plays of the time and being 
        a pie maker was an occupation in Ancient Greek society.</p>
        
     <p>The Romans were next.  Romans used pie pastry to preserve meat. Flour, oil and water were used to create a casing which would lock in
        the meats flavours and juices, but unlike today, the casing would not be eaten with the meat. Apicius, a Roman cookbook, includes recipes
        for different pie casings. As Rome expanded and roads were built throughout its empire, pie recipes spread throughout europe, landing 
        eventually in Britain.</p>   

    <h3 id="headline">Pie in Britain</h3>

    <p>Just like in Rome the casing of the first known pies in Britain were not often eaten.  Pies were used to keep food fresh for longer on long sea 
        voyages. Rather than take fresh ingredients and a cook, pies were easy to carry and easy to store.</p>

    <p>As time passed pies became much more than a convenient food for long trips. By Medieval times pies had become the centre piece of
       of banquets for kings and queens. Pies of this era would often contain meat or fish.</p>

    <p>Popular pie variations in the Uk today include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Meat and Potato Pie -</strong> A comforting pie, perfect for family dinners, made with potatoes, beef or lamb and carrots and onions.</li> 
    <li><strong>Steak and Ale PIe -</strong> Meat, beer, surrounded by a delicious golden pastry. It is obvious why this is a popular choice with Brits.</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken and Mushroom -</strong> A Classic and ranked as one of the most popular pies in Great Britain.  
                A creamy chicken and mushroom filling, sometimes made with bacon bits.</li>
    <li><strong>Leek and Potato -</strong> One for the vegetarians, but still a popular choice amongst meat eaters.</li>
    <li><strong>Pork Pie -</strong> A super traditional pie, served cold and a staple in every picnic. The pork pie has a minced pork and fat centre, surrounded
                by jellied pork stork in a thick hard crust.</li>
    </ul>
